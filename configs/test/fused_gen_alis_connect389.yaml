# In connecting anchor setup, this is applied between each pair of anchors.

# Note that we fix the vertical position at the center here for implementation simplicity.
# Otherwise, we need to additionally deal with the vertical position change while horizontally and iteratively connecting the new anchors.

# "patches": 
#     Sequentially (anchor=>fusion=>anchor=>fusion) save the image patches for infinite-fid calculation. 
# "patches-centercrop": 
#     Similar to the one above, but center crop the fusion patch (which is usually larger than the anchor patch).
# "anchors":
#     Save each pair of inbetweened anchors as a whole.
# "all-in-one":
#     Save a super-long that contains all patches
